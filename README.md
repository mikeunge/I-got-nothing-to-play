## About

Got no games? No problem!
With the I-Got-No-Games webapp you can _import_, _rate_ and _organize_ your games to your hearts belonging.

## Techstack

Symfony is the backend framework of choice.
For data persistance we use mariadb and to access all our data we use doctrine.
On the frontend we use the twig templating engine and tailwindcss for styling.

_All the services run inside of docker containers for better portability_.
